This is PDXMailer. It's built following Stephens Grider's Emaily app.

Architecture
The app has a Node/Express.js backend and a React.js frontend.
Redux for state management and MongoDB for its database.

Other 3rd Party services include:
- Google Auth for Sign in
- Stripe for payment
- SendMail to send and track responses

Having used many of these services in other apps, it was great fun putting this all together.
